Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, accounting for approximately 90% of all diabetes cases worldwide. It is primarily caused by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion in the pancreas. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes include frequent urination, increased thirst, fatigue, and blurred vision. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and neuropathy. Lifestyle changes, including diet modification, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight, can help manage type 2 diabetes.

      "1. Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels in the absence of insulin or insulin resistance [1]. The prevalence of T2DM has been increasing globally, with an estimated 10.5% of the world's population suffering from this disease by 2021 [2]. The progression of T2DM can be influenced by various factors, including genetic predisposition, lifestyle choices, and underlying health conditions [3]. One such factor is impaired ketone production, which can contribute to the development of T2DM in individuals with multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD). MADD is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in genes related to the flavoprotein complex [4]. The dysfunction of the complex leads to impaired fatty acid oxidation and ketone body production, which can cause hypoketotic hypoglycemia with prolonged fasting [5]. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Background\n",
      "\n",
      "MADD is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in genes related to the flavoprotein complex, such as ACADS1B (MIM1), ACADS2B (MIM2), ACADS2B (MIM2), and ACADS2B (MIM2) [6]. These genes play a crucial role in fatty acid oxidation by encoding subunits of the enzyme complexes involved in the oxidation of fatty acids [7]. When these genes are mutated, it leads to an impaired ability to oxidize fatty acids, resulting in ketone body production [8]. Ketone bodies are a source of energy for the body during periods of fasting or low glucose levels [9]. However, in individuals with MADD, the inability to produce ketone bodies can lead to hypoketotic hypoglycemia with prolonged fasting [10]. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Case Presentation\n",
      "\n",
      "We present the case of a 32-year-old man with MADD who was on a high-carbohydrate diet for &gt;30 years and exhibited symptoms resembling diabetic ketoacidosis. He presented with polydipsia, polyuria, and weight loss with a decrease in body mass index from 31 to 25 kg/m2 over 2 months. Laboratory tests revealed a HbA1c level of 13.9%; however, the patient did not show metabolic acidosis but only mild ketosis. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "This report emphasizes the potential association between long-term adherence to high-carbohydrate dietary therapy and the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with MADD. The case presented here highlights the importance of monitoring blood sugar levels in individuals with MADD, even if they are on a dietary regimen for an extended period. Furthermore, this case underscores the difficulty of detecting diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with FAODs such as MADD due to their inability to produce ketone bodies. These findings warrant further research on the long-term complications associated with this diet as well as warning of the potential progression of diabetes in patients with FAODs such as MADD. \n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, understanding the potential association between long-term adherence to high-carbohydrate dietary therapy and the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with MADD is crucial for early detection and management of this disease. Further research is necessary to explore the long-term complications of this diet and the potential progression of diabetes in patients with FAODs such as MADD."

Online ahead of print.ABSTRACTBACKGROUND: Luminal stenosis, computed tomography-derived fractional-flow reserve (FFRCT), and high-risk plaque features on coronary computed tomography angiography are all known to be associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The interactions between these variables, patient outcomes, and quantitative plaque volumes have not been previously described.METHODS: Patients with coronary computed tomography angiography (n=4430) and one-year outcome data from the international ADVANCE (Assessing Diagnostic Value of Noninvasive FFRCT in Coronary Care) registry underwent artificial intelligence-enabled quantitative coronary plaque analysis. Optimal cutoffs for coronary total plaque volume and each plaque subtype were derived using receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis. The resulting plaque volumes were adjusted for age, sex, hypertension, smoking status, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, luminal stenosis, distal FFRCT, and translesional delta-FFRCT. Median plaque volumes and optimal cutoffs for these adjusted variables were compared with major adverse cardiac events, late revascularization, a composite of the two, and cardiovascular death and myocardial infarction.RESULTS: At one year, 55 patients (1.2%) had experienced major adverse cardiac events, and 123 (2.8%) had undergone late revascularization (&gt;90 days). Following adjustment for age, sex, risk factors, stenosis, and FFRCT, total plaque volume above the receiver-operator characteristic curve-derived optimal cutoff (total plaque volume &gt;564 mm3) was associated with the major adverse cardiac event/late revascularization composite (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.515 [95% CI, 1.093-2.099]; P=0.0126), and both components. Total percent atheroma volume greater than the optimal cutoff was associated with both major adverse cardiac event/late revascularization (total percent atheroma volume &gt;24.4%; hazard ratio, 2.046 [95% CI, 1.474-2.839]; P&lt;0.0001) and cardiovascular death/myocardial infarction (total percent atheroma volume &gt;37.17%, hazard ratio, 4.53 [95% CI, 1.943-10.576]; P=0.0005). Calcified, noncalcified, and low-attenuation percentage atheroma volumes above the optimal cutoff were associated with all adverse outcomes, although this relationship was not maintained for cardiovascular death/myocardial infarction in analyses stratified by median plaque volumes.CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the ADVANCE registry using artificial intelligence-enabled quantitative plaque analysis shows that total plaque volume is associated with one-year adverse clinical events, with incremental predictive value over luminal stenosis or abnormal physiology by FFRCT.REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02499679.PMID:38469689 | DOI:10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.123.016143]]>\n",

The evidence suggests that dietary carbohydrate content may be related to sleep duration. We designed a study to investigate the association between a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) with long sleep duration (&gt; 8 h) and short sleep duration (&lt; 5 h). This cross-sectional analysis was conducted on data obtained from the recruitment phase of Yazd Health Study (YaHS) and the Taghzieh Mardom-e-YaZd (TAMYZ). The dietary intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. The LCD score was calculated for each subject based on summing up assigned scores to deciles of percentages of energy from macronutrients. Sleep duration was assessed using a nocturnal sleep questionnaire. The association between LCD and sleep duration was evaluated using logistic regressions in crude and adjusted models. A total of 5929 subjects were entered into the analysis. Most of the participants were aged 20-29 years (24.8%), male (52.2%) and never smokers (87.7%). After adjusting for level of physical activity, age, sex, total energy, smoking status and body mass index in model III, a significant direct association was observed between LCD score with long sleep duration (OR 1.15; 95% CI1-1.32, P = 0.049) and short sleep duration (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.02-1.62, P = 0.028). Higher LCD score is associated with higher chance of long sleep duration and short sleep duration. Regarding the nature of our study, cohort and clinical trial studies in future are required to reach a causal association and a definitive conclusion.PMID:38469424 | PMC:PMC10899938 | DOI:10.1007/s41105-022-00372-x]]>\n",

Therefore, this study was conducted to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy of PEG-Loxe in improving blood glucose (BG), BLP, BP, body mass index (BMI), and body weight (BW) in patients with T2DM for clinical reference. Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCT) in which PEG-Loxe was applied to treat T2DM were retrieved by searching PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Scientific Journal, Wanfang Data, and SinoMed databases. Outcome measures included BG, BLP, BP, BMI, and BW. RevMan 5.3 software was used to perform data analysis. Results: Eighteen trials were identified involving 2,166 patients. In experimental group 1,260 patients received PEG-Loxe alone or with other hypoglycemic agents, while in control group 906 patients received placebo or other hypoglycemic agents. In the overall analysis, PEG-Loxe significantly reduced the levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h postprandial blood glucose (2-h PBG), BMI, and BW compared with control group. However, it had no obvious effect on total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Conclusion: PEG-Loxe has better hypoglycemic effects compared with placebo in patients with T2DM, but could not significantly improved TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, SBP, and DBP. And the combination of conventional hypoglycemic drugs (CHD) and PEG-Loxe could more effectively improve the levels of HbA1c, FPG, 2-h PBG, TC, TG, BMI, and BW compared with CHD in T2DM patients.

This study aimed to describe and evaluate the impact of implementing a hybrid model of in-person and telemedicine care and education on glycemic control for patients with uncontrolled T2DM (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] ≥9%) during the coronavirus disease pandemic.METHODS: This prospective multicenter-cohort pre-/post-intervention study was conducted on patients with uncontrolled T2DM. This study included three chronic illness centers affiliated with the Family and Community Medicine Department at Prince Sultan Military Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A hybrid model of in-person (onsite) and telemedicine care and education was developed. This involved implementing initial in-person care at the physicians' clinic and initial in-person education at the diabetes education clinic, followed by telemedicine services of tele-follow-ups, support, and education for an average 4-month follow-up period.RESULTS: Of the enrolled 181 patients, more than half of the participants were women (n = 103, 56.9%). The mean age of participants (standard deviation) was 58.64 ± 11.23 years and the mean duration of diabetes mellitus was 13.80 ± 8.55 years. The majority of the patients (n = 144; 79.6%) were on insulin therapy. Overall, in all three centers, the hybrid model had significantly reduced HbA1c from 10.47 ± 1.23% to 7.87 ± 1.59% (mean difference of reduction 2.59% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.34-2.85%], p &lt; 0.001). At the level of each center, HbA1c was reduced significantly with mean differences of 3.17% (95% CI = 2.81-3.53%), 2.49% (95% CI = 1.92-3.06%), and 2.16% (95% CI = 1.76-2.57%) at centers A, B, and C, respectively (all p &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSION: The findings showed that the hybrid model of in-person and telemedicine care and education effectively managed uncontrolled T2DM.

This method facilitated the analysis of the diabetes burden across different ages, genders, and regions. To determine the long-term progression of type 2 diabetes prevalence, we computed the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) in burden rates.RESULTS: Globally, the number of deaths and DALYs from type 2 diabetes due to physical inactivity more than doubled between 1990 and 2019. Concurrently, there was an increase in the ASMR and ASDR, with EAPC of 0.26 (95% CI: 0.13-0.39) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.78-0.89), respectively. As of 2019, the global ASMR and ASDR for physical inactivity stood at 1.6 (95% UI: 0.8-2.7) per 100 000 and 55.9 (95% UI: 27.2-97.6) per 100 000, respectively. Notable disparities were observed in the type 2 diabetes burden associated with physical inactivity worldwide, with higher sociodemographic index (SDI) countries experiencing lower ASDR and ASMR compared to lower SDI countries. Initially, females exhibited higher ASMR and ASDR than males, but this gender disparity in ASMR and ASDR has lessened in recent years. The mortality and DALYs rates associated with physical inactivity exhibit an inverted V-shaped pattern across various age groups, predominantly affecting the elderly population.CONCLUSION: Between 1990 and 2019, there was a marked rise in the worldwide burden of type 2 diabetes associated with physical inactivity, underscoring the role of physical inactivity as a key changeable risk factor in the global landscape of this disease. This necessitates additional research to explore the variables contributing to the varying levels of disease burden across different countries and between sexes.

However, the importance of lifestyle management remains invaluable in treatment and tertiary prevention of this disease. Day-to-day sedentariness is the fourth most important risk factor for mortality in France. Numerous studies have demonstrated that physical activity is beneficial to people with type 2 diabetes and various recommendations have been made to encourage it. However, it is universally agreed that interventions that promote physical activity, while they may enhance its practice in the short term, do not impact on it over longer periods. It therefore seems essential to focus interventions on an individual's capacity to persist with physical activity in the long term. By looking at the literature, the aim of this review is to synthesize group and supervised physical activity interventions for people with type 2 diabetes using variables based on the following levers: motivation and self-efficacy.METHODS: The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology examined studies in English or French that are registered in the PubMed, PsycINFO, and SportDiscus databases and were published between 2005 and 2023, according to the following keywords: Motivation OR self-efficacy AND physical activity AND type 2 diabetes AND intervention.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Seven studies out of 1207 were included. Despite the pertinence of the concepts of motivation and self-efficacy and their complementarity in physical activity management programs, few studies have yet proposed a combined intervention for people with type 2 diabetes.PMID:38469114 | PMC:PMC10925881 | DOI:10.1002/hsr2.1644]]>\n",

This study aimed to develop and validate a multivariable risk score model to identify mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1256 inpatients (age: 57.5 ± 11.2 years) with T2DM in a tertiary care hospital in China. MCI was diagnosed according to the criteria recommended by the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association Workgroup, and a MoCA score of 19-25 indicated MCI. Participants were randomly allocated into the derivation and validation sets at 7:3 ratio. Logistic regression models were used to identify predictors for MCI in the derivation set. A scoring system based on the predictors' beta coefficient was developed. Predictive ability of the risk score was tested by discrimination and calibration methods.RESULTS: Totally 880 (285 with MCI, 32.4%) and 376 (167 with MCI, 33.8%) patients were allocated in the derivation and validation set, respectively. Age, education, HbA1c, self-reported history of severe hypoglycemia, and microvascular disease were identified as predictors for MCI and constituted the risk score. The AUCs (95% CI) of the risk score were 0.751 (0.717, 0.784) in derivation set and 0.776 (0.727, 0.824) in validation set. The risk score showed good apparent calibration of observed and predicted MCI probabilities and was capable of stratifying individuals into 3 risk categories by two cut-off points (low risk: ≤ 3, medium risk: 4-13, and high risk ≥ 14).CONCLUSION: The risk score based on age, education, HbA1c, self-reported history of severe hypoglycemia, and microvascular disease can effectively assess MCI risk in adults with T2DM at different age. It can serve as a practical prescreening tool for early detection of MCI in daily diabetes care.PMID:38469108 | PMC:PMC10926865 | DOI:10.2147/DMSO.S448321]]>\n",

      "Mol Genet Metab Rep. 2024 Jan 26;38:101061. doi: 10.1016/j.ymgmr.2024.101061. eCollection 2024 Mar.ABSTRACTBACKGROUND: Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in genes related to the flavoprotein complex. Dysfunction of the complex leads to impaired fatty acid oxidation and ketone body production which can cause hypoketotic hypoglycemia with prolonged fasting. Patients with fatty acid oxidation disorders (FAODs) such as MADD are treated primarily with a dietary regimen consisting of high-carbohydrate foods and avoidance of prolonged fasting. However, information on the long-term sequelae associated with this diet have not been accumulated. In general, high-carbohydrate diets can induce diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), although few patients with both MADD and T2DM have been reported.CASE: We present the case of a 32-year-old man with MADD who was on a high-carbohydrate diet for &gt;30 years and exhibited symptoms resembling diabetic ketoacidosis. He presented with polydipsia, polyuria, and weight loss with a decrease in body mass index from 31 to 25 kg/m2 over 2 months. Laboratory tests revealed a HbA1c level of 13.9%; however, the patient did not show metabolic acidosis but only mild ketosis.DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: This report emphasizes the potential association between long-term adherence to high-carbohydrate dietary therapy and T2DM development. Moreover, this case underscores the difficulty of detecting diabetic ketosis in patients with FAODs such as MADD due to their inability to produce ketone bodies. These findings warrant further research of the long-term complications associated with this diet as well as warning of the potential progression of diabetes in patients with FAODs such as MADD.PMID:38469101 | PMC:PMC10926221 | DOI:10.1016/j.ymgmr.2024.101061]]>\n",
